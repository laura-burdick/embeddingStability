# Factors Influencing the Surprising Instability of Word Embeddings

The code in this repository was used in the paper "Factors Influencing the Surprising Instability of Word Embeddings" by Wendlandt, et al. I have tried to document it well, but at the end of the day, it is research code, so if you have any problems using it, please get in touch with Laura Wendlandt (wenlaura@umich.edu).

If you use this code, please cite the following paper:
```
@article{Wendlandt18Surprising,
author = {Wendlandt, L. and J. Kummerfeld and R. Mihalcea},
title = {Factors Influencing the Surprising Instability of Word Embeddings},
journal = {NAACL-HLT},
year = {2018}
}
```

# Code Included
**stability.py**: Includes functions for calculating the stability of a word (as well as calculating the most similar words to that word, which is needed for calculating stability)

**example.py**: A toy example of how to use the stability code

**Regression Model**: Code to replicate the regression model found in the paper (Quick Start guide [here](regression/README.md))
